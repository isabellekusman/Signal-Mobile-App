# Terms of Service for Signal

**Last Updated:** February 22, 2026

Welcome to Signal ("we," "our," or "us"). By downloading, installing, or using the Signal mobile application (the "App"), you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please review these Terms carefully. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the App.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you") and Signal concerning your access to and use of the App. You agree that by accessing the App, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms.

## 2. Description of Service

Signal provides a relationship journaling and analytics tool that models connection dynamics, utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate insights (e.g., the Decoder, Clarity chats, Stars Align forecasts), and allows users to track their behavioral patterns.

## 3. Subscriptions and Purchases

Certain features within the App are offered behind a subscription paywall ("Premium"). All subscription fees are managed through Apple's App Store according to their standard terms. By subscribing to Signal Premium, you agree to:
*   Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
*   Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
*   You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.

## 4. Disclaimers: Not Professional Advice

The App, including all AI-generated content (e.g., the "Decoder", "Clarity", "Stars Align", and profile analyses), is for **educational, entertainment, and self-reflection purposes only.**

You acknowledge and agree that:
*   Signal does not provide psychological, medical, therapy, or professional dating advice.
*   The AI analyses are generated by generalized models based solely on the text and context you manually input. These outputs are interpretations, not objective facts.
*   You must not rely on the App for making critical life decisions, assessing mental health, or replacing professional counseling. If you need support, please contact a licensed mental health professional.

## 5. User Content and Conduct

You remain solely responsible for any data, logs, notes, or chat messages you submit to the App ("User Content"). By using the App, you agree NOT to:
*   Input sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to third parties without their explicit consent.
*   Input highly regulated information (e.g., medical diagnoses, financial details).
*   Use the App, or its AI components, to target, harass, stalk, or abuse any individual.
*   Attempt to reverse engineer, scrape, or extract the AI prompts or system architecture.

We reserve the right to suspend or ban any user who violates these Terms, including the right to refuse service.

## 6. AI Output Generation

The insights produced by the App are processed by third-party AI models (e.g., Google Gemini). Due to the nature of generative AI, the App's outputs may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or offensive. By using the App, you accept this risk and release us from any liability related to the outputs generated by the AI system.

## 7. Account Deletion

You can permanently delete your account and all associated User Content at any time via the "Delete Account" option in the App's settings. Upon deletion, your data will be permanently purged from our active databases and your session will be instantly invalidated.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Signal be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this App.
